### Description

Visual Sound Amplitude Modulation.

An example of determining amplitude whilst playing and processing a sound file buffer using and instance of DirectX 8's DirectSound8 class.

Amplitude modulation is displayed by use of a Slider Active-X Control, and by displaying a sequence of images whose image reflects the current amplitutde of the sample being processed.

This project was requested by PSCode user: Maxwolf. The 'Devil' character images are property of his company, when he requested the project he also transmitted these image files to me so that I could incorporate these images in the example. You may not re-use these images in you're own application without his written consent. If you wish to contact 'Maxwolf', you may do so via e-mail: maxwolf@columbus.rr.com
